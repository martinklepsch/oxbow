# oxbow

A Server Sent Events (SSE) client for Clojurescript based on js/fetch

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/oliyh/oxbow.svg)](https://clojars.org/oliyh/oxbow)

This library uses js/fetch to expose the full functionality of HTTP and processes the SSE data for you.

It's ready for use as a standalone functional Clojurescript library and also has re-frame bindings for integration
into a re-frame application.

## Rationale

js/EventSource is generally moribund and does not support sending headers.
Discussions generally reference js/fetch as a modern alternative but it does not natively process streams.
